The purpose of this project was to compare the base performance of three different Cox Proportional-Hazards Models on a set of synthetic/fake data. There are three different models that are hosted in this repository:
- A Classical Cox Proportional-Hazards Model
- An XGBoost Cox Model
- A CatBoost Cox Model
